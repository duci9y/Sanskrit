#  The Sanskrit Game

A game to help you learn and practice basic Sanskrit. Can be modified to
use other languages.

I made this game in 11th grade for a competition. It was not accepted as an
entry because they asked for storyboards/concept boards instead of an actual
app... (the teacher supervising my work misunderstood the pamphlet).

I learnt a lot about:

 1. **SpriteKit** and how little precison you can get away with in mobile
 games. And how it uses Box2D internally.

 2. **How to use FBTweak to change constants on the fly without recompiling.**
 The organizer of this competition was the national education board back home
 in India, so it was highly regarded by the school. The administration and my
 supervisor wanted it to be ~perfect~ so they made me tweak things like colors
 and border radii a lot.

 3. **Returns on an investment may not be realized until much later.** I saw
 this project as a waste of my time when I found out it wasn't eligible for
 the competition. But now it is a big chunk of my portfolio.
